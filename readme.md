# Assignment 1 readme

## Datasets:

1. Heart Disease Dataset: Download from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/data
2. Spambase: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/94/spambase

## Before running:

1. Ensure that all the packages mentioned in requirements.txt is present in your env
2. To run Neural Network code it is better to run it in google collab or similar, there are chances that your system crashes if you run locally
3. Download, if not present the datasets - they should be named: heart.csv, spambase.data, spambase.names

## Files to run

1. Heart disease.ipynb - run this to get analysis of KNN, SVM and NN on heart disease dataset.
2. spambase.ipynb - run this to get analysis of KNN, SVM and NN on spambase dataset.

## How to run:

1. Clone: 
2.Start launch jupyter from anaconda
3. Navigate to folder
4. Choose either: Heart disease.ipynb or spambase.ipynb
5. Run all cells in them sequentially.
